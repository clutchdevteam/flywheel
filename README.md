# Flywheel

## What is Flywheel?

Flywheel is the default scaffold used by the Clutch Dev team at the beginning of a new project. This is barebones Nuxt app, set up with Tailwind, and a connection to Storyblok ready to go.

## Setup

This project is _only_ to be used as a jumping off point for new projects. No client specific components, plugins, or modules should be added in this repo.

Setup is pretty quick and simple.

1. Fork this repo into a new project directory
2. Run `yarn` to install any dependencies
3. Create any necessary client accounts (i.e.: Storyblok, Netlify, etc..)
4. Create a space within Storyblok and add the API key (found in the settings tab) to a `.env` at the root of the directory

## How to use

This project is meant to save some time with the initial setup a of a new project.

Once this initial setup is done, you can proceed with creating components and schemas in Storyblok, and then building the necessary Vue components to match!
